# Data Warehouse

SQL Server Data Warehouse Project

## Data Warehouse
- A subject-oriented, integrated, time-variant, and non-volatile collection of data in support of management's decision-making process.

## ETL
- ETL stands for Extract, Transform, Load. It's a data integration process used to combine data from multiple sources into a single, unified repository, often a data warehouse or data lake. This process involves extracting data from various sources, transforming it into a usable format, and then loading it into the target system.
